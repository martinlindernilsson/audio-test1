			<p>	You are about participate in a listening test in which you will be able to alter the characteristics of 
				sound clips in various ways with a slider.
				You will be asked to find a position on the slider where you can follow the speech as clearly as possible while 
				still maintaining a satisfactory overall listening experience.</p>
			<p>Each sound clip is an approximately 20 second long outtake from Swedish Radio, SR, and will be played in a loop 
				when started. 
				When deciding on your preferred position on the slider, please take the entirety of the sound clip into 
				consideration.</p>
			<p> For each sound clip, note your resulting number in the Google form. You might want to keep both windows open 
				side by side to	make this process easier.</p>
			<p>The test consists of 14 sound examples and will take approximately 10 minutes.</p>

			<p>Thanks for your participation!</p>
