			<p>	You are about participate in a listening test in which you will be able to alter the characteristics of 
				sound clips in various ways with a slider. In some cases the changes will seem subtle, in others more distinct.</p>
			<p>	Your task for each sound clip is to find a position on the slider where you can follow the speech as clearly as possible while 
				still maintaining a satisfactory overall listening experience.</p>
			<p>Each sound clip is an approximately 20 second long outtake from Swedish Radio, SR, and will be played in a loop 
				when started. For some of the sound examples, a background noise will also be played that can not be altered by the slider.
				When deciding on your preferred position on the slider, please take the entirety of the sound clip into 
				consideration.</p>
			<p> For each sound clip, note your resulting number in the Google form in the previous window. You might want to keep both windows open 
				side by side to	make this process easier.</p>
			<p>The test consists of __ sound examples and will take approximately 10 minutes.</p>

			<p>Thanks for your participation!</p>
