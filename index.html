			<h1>Listening test</h1>
			<p>Consider that one were to offer a feature that applies compression to select 
				broadcasted content, with the aim of increasing intelligibility in noisy environments. </p>
			<p>You are about participate in a sound test in which you will be able to control the amount of compression 
				applied to sound files with a slider. You will then be asked to give your opinion on what 
				would be a good range of compression to use for such a feature. The effect should be noticable, 
				it should however not degrade the sound quality too much or make the content straining to listen to.</p>
			<p>The test consists of four sound examples and will take approximately 5 minutes.</p>
